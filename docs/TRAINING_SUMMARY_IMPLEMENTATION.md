# Training Summary Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive training summary modal that appears when training stops due to surrender, wrong move, or timeout. The summary includes the number of passed moves with corresponding emojis and options to repeat training or close the summary.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Training Summary Modal

A new modal (`#training-summary-modal`) that displays:
- **Moves Passed**: Number of moves successfully completed
- **Session Ended**: Reason for ending with appropriate emoji
- **Duration**: How long the training session lasted
- **Engine**: Which engine was used (Stockfish or Leela Chess Zero)
- **Playing as**: Whether the user was playing as White or Black

### 2. End Reason Tracking

The system now tracks different end reasons with appropriate emojis:
- ‚è∞ **Timeout**: When the 5-minute timer expires
- üè≥Ô∏è **Surrender**: When user clicks the surrender button
- ‚èπÔ∏è **Manual Stop**: When user manually stops training
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error**: When an error occurs during training

### Wrong Move Penalty System

When a wrong move is detected:
- A 30-second penalty is subtracted from the remaining time
- The training round restarts automatically
- If the penalty causes time to run out, training stops with timeout
- Training does NOT stop just for wrong moves - it continues with penalty

### 3. Enhanced stopTraining Function

The `stopTraining(message, endReason)` function now:
- Accepts an `endReason` parameter to categorize the stop reason
- Shows the training summary modal instead of a simple alert
- Tracks training duration from start to end
- Displays comprehensive session statistics

### 4. Action Buttons

Two action buttons in the summary modal:
- **üîÑ Repeat Training**: Automatically restarts training with the same parameters
- **‚úñÔ∏è Close**: Simply closes the summary and returns to training settings

### 5. Training State Tracking

New variables added:
- `trainingStartTime`: Records when training begins
- `trainingEndReason`: Stores the reason training ended

## Implementation Details

### HTML Structure

```html
<!-- Training Summary Modal -->
<div id="training-summary-modal" class="trainer-controls" style="display: none;">
  <h5>üìä Training Session Summary</h5>
  
  <!-- Moves Passed Display -->
  <div id="summary-moves-passed" class="h4 text-success">0</div>
  
  <!-- End Reason Display -->
  <div id="summary-end-reason" class="h5 text-dark font-weight-bold"></div>
  
  <!-- Session Details -->
  <div>Duration: <span id="summary-duration"></span></div>
  <div>Engine: <span id="summary-engine-used"></span></div>
  <div>Playing as: <span id="summary-orientation-used"></span></div>
  
  <!-- Action Buttons -->
  <button id="repeat-training">üîÑ Repeat Training</button>
  <button id="close-summary">‚úñÔ∏è Close</button>
</div>
```

### JavaScript Functions

#### showTrainingSummary(message)
- Hides all other modals and shows the summary
- Calculates training duration
- Determines end reason with appropriate emoji
- Updates all summary display elements

#### Updated stopTraining(message, endReason)
- Now accepts an `endReason` parameter
- Calls `showTrainingSummary()` instead of showing alert
- Maintains existing functionality for resetting training state

### Event Handlers

#### Repeat Training Button
```javascript
$('#repeat-training').on('click', function() {
  // Hide summary and show settings
  $('#training-summary-modal').hide();
  $('#training-settings').show();
  
  // Restore previous training parameters
  // Automatically start training
});
```

#### Close Summary Button
```javascript
$('#close-summary').on('click', function() {
  // Hide summary and show settings
  $('#training-summary-modal').hide();
  $('#training-settings').show();
});
```

## Updated Function Calls

All `stopTraining()` calls have been updated to include the appropriate end reason:

- `stopTraining('Time is up!', 'timeout')`
- `stopTraining('Training session ended by surrender.', 'surrender')`
- `stopTraining('', 'manual')`
- `stopTraining('Error occurred during training.', 'error')`

## Wrong Move Handling

When a wrong move is detected:
1. The hint modal is shown with optimal moves
2. When user clicks "Continue Training":
   - 30 seconds is subtracted from the remaining time
   - If time runs out due to penalty, training stops with timeout
   - Otherwise, the training round restarts automatically
3. Training continues with the time penalty - it does not stop just for wrong moves

## User Experience

1. **Training Ends**: Instead of a simple alert, users see a comprehensive summary
2. **Clear Information**: Users can see exactly how many moves they passed and why training ended
3. **Quick Restart**: The "Repeat Training" button allows immediate restart with same settings
4. **Flexible Options**: Users can either repeat or return to settings to make changes

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Starting a training session
2. Triggering different end conditions (timeout, surrender, wrong move)
3. Verifying the summary modal appears with correct information
4. Testing the repeat training and close buttons

## Compatibility

This implementation:
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Uses existing CSS classes and styling patterns
- Integrates seamlessly with the current hint system
- Preserves all existing training features
